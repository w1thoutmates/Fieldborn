 In **Fieldborn**, each move matters. Collect and place shapes made of cubes to complete lines, triggering powerful effects:
- 🟥 Red dominant color lines → Damage Enemies  
- 🟩 Green dominant color lines → Heal Yourself  
- 🟦 Blue dominant color lines → Gain Shield

Each round consists of alternating turns between the player and the enemy. After 5 turns each, all effects are resolved — including attacks, heals, and shields — before a new round begins.
